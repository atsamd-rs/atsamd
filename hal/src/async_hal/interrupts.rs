//! # Async interrupts
//!
//! This module provides APIs specific to working with interrupts in an async
//! peripheral context.
//!
//! Asynchronous programming relies on tasks that can be paused and resumed
//! without blocking the entire program. When an async task is waiting for a
//! particular event, such as data from a peripheral, it enters a suspended
//! state. It is crucial that the task is properly woken up when the expected
//! event occurs to resume its execution.
//!
//! By having peripherals take interrupts, they can signal the occurrence of
//! relevant events, effectively waking up the associated async tasks. This
//! ensures that the async runtime can schedule and resume tasks in a timely
//! manner, providing the responsiveness required in embedded systems.
//!
//! ## Typelevel and enum-level interrupts
//!
//! There are two main ways of representing interrupts in the HAL: either by
//! using [`pac::Interrupt`], where each interrupt is represented as an enum
//! variant, or by using the typelevel interrupts defined in this module. Each
//! interrupt source *that is usable with async peripherals* is declared as a
//! struct with the same name of the corresponsing [`pac::Interrupt`] variant.
//! Therefore, two distinct traits are needed to perform basic tasks on
//! interrupt types:
//!
//! * Use [`Interrupt`] when dealing with the typelevel interrupt types defined
//!   in this module;
//! * Use [`InterruptExt`] when dealing with enum-level interrupt types defined
//!   in [`pac`].
//!
//! [`pac::Interrupt`]: crate::pac::Interrupt
//! [`Interrupt`]: crate::async_hal::interrupts::Interrupt
//! [`InterruptExt`]: crate::async_hal::interrupts::InterruptExt
//! [`pac`]: crate::pac
