//! # Abstractions over individual DMA channels
//!
//! # Initializing
//!
//! Individual channels should be initialized through the
//! [`Channel::init`] method. This will return a `Channel<Id, Ready>` ready for
//! use by a [`Transfer`](super::transfer::Transfer). Initializing a channel
//! requires setting a priority level, as well as enabling or disabling
//! interrupt requests (only for the specific channel being initialized).
//!
//! # Burst Length and FIFO Threshold (SAMD51/SAME5x only)
//!
//! The transfer burst length can be configured through the
//! [`Channel::burst_length`] method. A burst is an atomic,
//! uninterruptible transfer which length corresponds to a number of beats. See
//! SAMD5x/E5x datasheet section 22.6.1.1 for more information. The FIFO
//! threshold can be configured through the
//! [`Channel::fifo_threshold`] method. This enables the channel
//! to wait for multiple Beats before sending a Burst. See SAMD5x/E5x datasheet
//! section 22.6.2.8 for more information.
//!
//! # Channel status
//!
//! Channels can be in any of three statuses: [`Uninitialized`], [`Ready`], and
//! [`Busy`]. These statuses are checked at compile time to ensure they are
//! properly initialized before launching DMA transfers.
//!
//! # Resetting
//!
//! Calling the [`Channel::reset`] method will reset the channel to its
//! `Uninitialized` state. You will be required to call [`Channel::init`]
//! again before being able to use it with a `Transfer`.
