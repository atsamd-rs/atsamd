//! # DMA transfer abstractions
//!
//! # Transfer types
//!
//! Four basic transfer types are supported:
//!
//! * Incrementing-source to incrementing-destination (normally used for
//!   memory-to-memory transfers)
//!
//! * Incrementing-source to fixed-destination (normally used for
//!   memory-to-peripheral transfers)
//!
//! * Fixed-source to incrementing-destination (normally used for
//!   peripheral-to-memory transfers)
//!
//! * Fixed-source to fixed-destination (normally used for
//!   peripheral-to-peripheral transfers)
//!
//! # Beat sizes
//!
//! A beat is an atomic, uninterruptible transfer size.Three beat sizes are
//! supported:
//!
//! * Byte-per-byte (8 bit beats);
//!
//! * Halfword-per-halfword (16 bit beats);
//!
//! * Word-per-word (32 bit beats);
//!
//! The correct beat size will automatically be selected in function of the type
//! of the source and destination buffers.
//!
//! # One-shot vs circular transfers
//!
//! If the transfer is setup as one-shot (`circular == false`), the
//! transfer will run once and stop. Otherwise, if `circular == true`, then the
//! transfer will be set as circular, meaning it will restart a new, identical
//! block transfer when the current block transfer is complete. This is
//! particularly useful when combined with a TC/TCC trigger source, for instance
//! to periodically retreive a sample from an ADC and send it to a circular
//! buffer, or send a sample to a DAC.
//!
//! # Starting a transfer
//!
//! A transfer is started by calling [`Transfer::begin`]. You will be
//! required to supply a trigger source and a trigger action.
//!
//! # Waiting for a transfer to complete
//!
//! A transfer can waited upon by calling [`wait`](Transfer::wait). This is a
//! _blocking_ method, meaning it will busy-wait until the transfer is
//! completed. When it returns, it will release the source and destination
//! buffers, as well as the DMA channel.
//!
//! # Interrupting (stopping) a transfer
//!
//! A transfer can be stopped (regardless of whether it has completed or not) by
//! calling [`stop`](Transfer::stop). This is _not_ a blocking method,
//! meaning it will stop the transfer and immediately return. When it returns,
//! it will release the source and destination buffers, as well as the DMA
//! channel.
//!
//! # Trigger sources
//!
//! Most peripherals can issue triggers to a DMA channel. A software trigger is
//! also available (see [`trigger`](Transfer::software_trigger)). See
//! ATSAMD21 datasheet, table 19-8 for all available trigger sources.
//!
//! # Trigger actions
//!
//! Three trigger actions are available:
//!
//! * BLOCK: One trigger required for each block transfer. In the context of
//!   this driver, one Transfer is equivalent to one Block transfer.
//!
//! * BEAT: One trigger required for each beat transfer. In the context of this
//!   driver, the beat size will depend on the type of buffer used (8, 16 or 32
//!   bits).
//!
//! * TRANSACTION: One trigger required for a full DMA transaction. this is
//!   useful for circular transfers in the context of this driver. One trigger
//!   will set off the transaction, that will now run uninterrupted until it is
//!   stopped.
