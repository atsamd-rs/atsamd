/// Type-level enum representing the SPI transaction length, in bytes
///
/// This trait acts as both a [type-level enum], forming a type class for
/// transaction lengths, as well as a [type-level function] mapping the `Length`
/// to the corresponding [`Word`] size.
///
/// The SPI transaction length is represented in the type domain using
/// [`Unsigned`] types from the [`typenum`] crate. The length can be set
/// statically, using a length from `U1` to `U255`, or it can be set
/// dynamically, using the [`DynLength`] marker type. All valid `Length` types
/// are re-exported in this module.
///
/// The SPI transaction length affects the word size for the embedded HAL
/// traits, as well as other aspects of the SPI API. Transaction lengths of 1-4
/// only require a single read/write of the `DATA` register, so they have an
/// [`AtomicSize`] behave differently than longer transaction lengths.
