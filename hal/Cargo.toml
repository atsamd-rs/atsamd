[features]
# We default to picking one of the target mcus so that a `cargo build` or
# `cargo package` run for this crate will succeed.  Without this we won't
# pull in any mcu crate and that would fail.  Board support crates that
# pull in this hal are likely to want to use default-features=false when
# adding their dep on "atsamd21-hal".
default = ["samd21g18a"]

# This section lists our feature name to dependency mapping.  This are separated
# out so that the board support crates can reference a single feature name to
# select the appropriate chip, and to keep that separate from the dependency name
# for the `rt` feature below, which has to list out all possible optional deps.
# If we simply used feature names that matched the dependency names, enabling the
# rt feature would link all possible parts in and cause a linker error due to
# the high degree of similar symbols present in the various parts.
