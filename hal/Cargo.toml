[features]
# This section lists our feature name to dependency mapping.  This are separated
# out so that the board support crates can reference a single feature name to
# select the appropriate chip, and to keep that separate from the dependency name
# for the `rt` feature below, which has to list out all possible optional deps.
# If we simply used feature names that matched the dependency names, enabling the
# rt feature would link all possible parts in and cause a linker error due to
# the high degree of similar symbols present in the various parts.
