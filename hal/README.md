# HAL for working with atsamd21 devices

This crate provides a type-safe API for working with atsamd21 based devices.
Currently this crate supports `atsamd21g18a` or `atsamd21e18a` (selectable
via the `samd21g18a` or `samd21e18a` features), and should be able to support
other variants in a similar fashion; pull requests for this are welcomed!
