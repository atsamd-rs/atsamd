# Adafruit EdgeBadge Board Support Crate

This crate provides a type-safe API for working with the [Adafruit EdgeBadge
board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400).

Check out the repository for examples:
https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/tree/master/boards/edgebadge/examples

## Prerequisites
* Install the cross compile toolchain `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf`
* Install [hf2-cli](https://crates.io/crates/hf2-cli) the uf2 bootloader flasher tool however your platform requires

* Be in this directory `cd boards/edgebadge`
* Put your device in bootloader mode usually by hitting the reset button twice.

### Uploading an example: cargo run

The `.cargo/config` in this bsp is preset with `hf2-cli` as a `runner`. This means you can use cargo run to both cargo build and attempt to upload:
```bash
$ cargo run --release --example blinky_basic
```

Or even better just your ide's "run" button or hotkey and cargo run will build and upload.

## troubleshooting
Note some examples will tell you they need more features enabled
```
$ cargo run --release --example neopixel_easing
error: target `neopixel_easing` in package `edgebadge` requires the features: `math`
Consider enabling them by passing, e.g., `--features="math"`
```
Just follow the instructions to add --features like
```
cargo run --release --example neopixel_easing --features="math"
